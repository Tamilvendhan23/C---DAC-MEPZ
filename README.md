# C DAC MEPZ – Internship Learning Repository

Welcome to my internship repository for Python for Data Science at DAC-MEPZ!

This repository tracks my hands-on learning journey and progress as I complete assignments, write utilities, and take learning notes. **Work is in progress** and new content will be added as I move forward in my internship.
