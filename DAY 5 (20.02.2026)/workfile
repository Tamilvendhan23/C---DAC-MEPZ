Assignment Title
Employee Payroll & Management System (OOP-Based Design)

Problem Statement

We are building an internal Employee Payroll and Management System for his Bangalore-
based training and consulting firm.

You are required to design and implement this system using Object-Oriented Programming
principles in Python.
The solution must be modular, clean, and must demonstrate correct use of OOP features
covered in Day 5.

Core Requirements

1. Base Class – Person

Create a class Person that represents a generic person.
Attributes
name (public)
city (public)
Methods

def __init__(self, name: str, city: str):
pass

2/6
def get_details(self) -> str:
"""
Returns formatted string containing person details.
"""

2. Custom Exception Class
Create a custom exception class:

class InvalidSalaryError(Exception):
pass

This exception must be raised whenever an invalid salary is provided.

3. Derived Class – Employee
Create a class Employee that inherits from Person.

Attributes
Attribute Type Visibility
emp_id str public
__salary float private
company_name str static
Set:

company_name = "Vinod Technologies"

Constructor

def __init__(self, emp_id: str, name: str, city: str, salary: float):
pass

Constructor Requirements

3/6
Call the parent class constructor using super()
Validate salary
Raise InvalidSalaryError if salary <= 0
Initialize all member variables

4. Member Methods
Implement the following methods:

def get_salary(self) -> float:
"""
Returns the private salary value.
"""

def update_salary(self, new_salary: float) -> None:
"""
Updates salary after validation.
"""

def get_details(self) -> str:
"""
Overrides Person.get_details()
Includes employee ID and salary.
"""

5. Static Methods
Implement a static method:

@staticmethod
def is_valid_salary(salary: float) -> bool:
"""
Returns True if salary is positive.
"""

Use this method inside the constructor and salary update logic.

6. Operator Overloading

Vinod Kumar Kayartaya vinod@vinod.co

4/6

Overload the + operator so that:

emp1 + emp2

returns the total salary of both employees.
Requirement

def __add__(self, other):
pass

Validate that:
other is an instance of Employee
Raise TypeError otherwise

7. Demonstration Script
Write a separate script (main.py) that:
1. Creates multiple Employee objects
2. Prints employee details
3. Updates salary
4. Demonstrates operator overloading
5. Demonstrates inheritance behavior
6. Handles custom exceptions using try-except
7. Accesses static members correctly

Example Usage Flow (Conceptual)

Create Employee
Print Details
Update Salary
Add Two Employees (Salary)
Trigger Invalid Salary Error
Display Company Name

Technical Constraints

Vinod Kumar Kayartaya vinod@vinod.co

5/6

Do NOT access private members directly outside the class
Do NOT use global variables
Use super() for inheritance
Use meaningful method and variable names
Follow PEP 8 naming conventions

Optional Enhancement (Bonus)
Overload __str__() to return readable employee details
Overload __eq__() to compare employees by emp_id
Add a class method to change company name

Expected Output Characteristics
Clear and readable console output
Proper error messages from custom exceptions
No uncaught exceptions
Logical and consistent behavior
