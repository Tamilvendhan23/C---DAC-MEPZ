Assignment Title
Employee Management Console Application (Modular & Packaged)
Problem Statement
Vinod runs a Python training and consulting firm in Bangalore. You are required to build a
modular, package-based employee management system that:
Uses proper Python packages and modules
Runs inside a virtual environment
Reads and writes employee data to text files
Handles exceptions correctly
Uses context managers for file operations
Demonstrates different function argument types
Can be executed as a standalone application
Follows professional project structure
Mandatory Project Structure
You must follow this structure exactly:

Environment Setup (Mandatory)
1. Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv 
Activate it before running the project.
2. Use pip Inside Virtual Environment
Install at least one external package (for example: 
tabulate
 or 
colorama
)
Add it to 
requirements.txt
pip freeze > requirements.txt 
Functional Requirements
2/7


1. Employee Data Model
Employee data should be represented using a dictionary:
{ 
} 
"id": "EMP101", 
"name": "Vinod", 
"city": "Bangalore", 
"salary": 75000 
All employees are stored in a list of dictionaries in memory.
2. 
employee_service.py
 (Core Business Logic)
Implement the following functions:
def add_employee(emp_list: list, emp_id: str, name: str, city: str, 
salary: float) -> None: 
""" 
    Adds a new employee to the list. 
    """ 
def edit_employee(emp_list: list, emp_id: str, **updates) -> None: 
""" 
    Updates employee details using keyword arguments. 
    Example updates: name, city, salary 
    """ 
def delete_employee(emp_list: list, emp_id: str) -> None: 
""" 
    Deletes an employee by ID. 
    """ 
def list_employees(emp_list: list) -> list: 
""" 
    Returns the list of all employees. 
    """ 
3/7
Expectations


Use 
**kwargs
 for flexible updates
Raise 
ValueError
 if employee ID does not exist
Salary must always be positive
No file handling logic in this module
3. 
file_utils.py
 (File Handling + Context Managers)
Implement:
def load_employees(file_path: str) -> list: 
""" 
    Reads employee data from a text file and returns a list. 
    Must use context manager. 
    """ 
def save_employees(file_path: str, emp_list: list) -> None: 
""" 
    Writes employee data to file safely. 
    Must use context manager. 
    """ 
File Format (employees.txt)
EMP101,Vinod,Bangalore,75000 
EMP102,Amit,Delhi,60000 
Implement reusable validation functions:
4. 
validation_utils.py
 (Exception Handling)
def validate_employee_id(emp_id: str) -> None: 
""" 
    Raises ValueError if ID is invalid. 
    """ 
def validate_salary(salary: float) -> None: 
""" 
    Raises ValueError if salary is not positive. 
    """

Vinod Kumar Kayartaya
def validate_non_empty(value: str, field_name: str) -> None:
""" 
    Raises ValueError if string is empty. 
    """ 
5. 
app.py
 (Application Entry Point)
This file must:
Act as the only executable file
Contain a menu-driven program
Import all required services and utilities
Use 
if __name__ == "__main__"
Menu Options
1. Add Employee 
2. Edit Employee 
3. Delete Employee 
4. List Employees 
5. Save to File 
6. Exit 
vinod@vinod.co
Mandatory Expectations in 
app.py
Use positional + keyword arguments when calling functions
Wrap menu execution in 
try-except
Handle:
ValueError
FileNotFoundError
Generic Exception (last)
On exit, ask user whether to save data
6. PYTHONPATH Requirement
5/7
You must ensure that:


Packages (
services
, 
utils
) are importable
Imports work without modifying code paths
Validation method:
import sys
print(sys.path)
You should explain (in README):
How Python finds their packages
Whether PYTHONPATH was required or not
7. README.txt (Mandatory Explanation)
You must explain:
. How to activate the virtual environment
. How to run 
app.py
. What each package does
. How file handling is implemented
. How exception handling is structured
. How context managers are used
. Where function argument types are demonstrated
Constraints
No global variables for employee data
No direct file access inside service layer
No hardcoded file paths
No modification of PYTHONPATH in production-style code
Evaluation Criteria
Area
Weightage
