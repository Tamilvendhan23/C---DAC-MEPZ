Day 3 Assignment
Topics: Tuple, Set, Dictionary Instructor: Vinod

General Instructions
1. Follow modular design.
2. Use proper function definitions (no full logic in global scope).
3. Validate inputs.
4. Raise appropriate exceptions where necessary.
5. Use meaningful variable names.
6. Follow PEP 8 guidelines.
7. Organize each problem in a separate folder (similar to Day 2 structure).
Part A – Tuple-Based Assignments (2)

Tuple Assignment 1: Immutable Employee Record System
Scenario
You are maintaining employee records for Vinod’s Bangalore training center. Each employee
record must be stored as a tuple in the format:

(employee_id, name, city, salary)

Requirements
Write the following functions:

def create_employee(emp_id: str, name: str, city: str, salary: float)
-> tuple:
"""
Returns an employee record as a tuple.
Validate inputs properly.
"""



2/9

def update_salary(employee: tuple, new_salary: float) -> tuple:
"""
Since tuples are immutable, return a new tuple with updated
salary.
Original tuple must not be modified.
"""

def get_employee_details(employee: tuple) -> str:
"""
Returns formatted string containing employee details.
"""

Expectations
Do not attempt to modify tuple directly.
Demonstrate immutability concept.
Return new tuples where required.
Validate salary must be positive.

Tuple Assignment 2: Tuple Data Analysis
You are given a tuple of monthly revenues:

revenues = (120000, 150000, 90000, 200000, 175000)

Write the following functions:

def get_highest_revenue(revenues: tuple) -> int:
"""
Returns the highest revenue.
"""

def get_lowest_revenue(revenues: tuple) -> int:
"""
Returns the lowest revenue.
"""



3/9

def count_revenue_occurrence(revenues: tuple, value: int) -> int:
"""
Returns how many times a revenue value appears.
"""

Expectations
Use tuple methods where applicable.
Do not convert tuple to list unless absolutely necessary.
Maintain immutability principle.
Part B – Set-Based Assignments (2)

Set Assignment 1: Student Enrollment System
Vinod conducts training in multiple cities.
Two batches:

batch_bangalore = {"Amit", "Ravi", "Sneha", "Priya"}
batch_pune = {"Ravi", "Karan", "Sneha", "Meena"}

Write the following functions:

def get_all_students(batch1: set, batch2: set) -> set:
"""
Returns union of both batches.
"""

def get_common_students(batch1: set, batch2: set) -> set:
"""
Returns intersection of both batches.
"""

def get_exclusive_students(batch1: set, batch2: set) -> set:
"""
Returns students who are only in batch1.
"""



4/9

Expectations
Use set operations (|, &, -).
Do not manually loop.
Validate inputs are sets.

Set Assignment 2: Unique Skill Tracker
You are given a list of skills reported by employees:

skills = ["Python", "SQL", "Python", "Docker", "SQL", "AWS"]

Write:

def get_unique_skills(skill_list: list) -> set:
"""
Returns a set of unique skills.
"""

def add_skill(skill_set: set, skill: str) -> None:
"""
Adds a new skill to the set.
"""

def remove_skill(skill_set: set, skill: str) -> None:
"""
Removes a skill safely (should not crash if skill not found).
"""

Expectations
Use set conversion.
Use discard() where appropriate.
Demonstrate uniqueness behavior.
Part C – Dictionary-Based Assignments (2)

Dict Assignment 1: Employee Directory



5/9

Create a dictionary structure:

employees = {
"EMP101": {"name": "Vinod", "city": "Bangalore", "salary":
75000},
"EMP102": {"name": "Amit", "city": "Delhi", "salary": 60000}
}

Write the following functions:

def add_employee(directory: dict, emp_id: str, data: dict) -> None:
"""
Adds a new employee to directory.
"""

def get_employee(directory: dict, emp_id: str) -> dict:
"""
Returns employee details safely.
"""

def delete_employee(directory: dict, emp_id: str) -> None:
"""
Deletes employee if exists.
"""

Expectations
Validate emp_id existence.
Use dictionary methods properly.
Do not crash on missing keys.

Dict Assignment 2: Sales Summary Generator
You are given:

sales = {
"Mumbai": 120000,
"Delhi": 95000,
"Chennai": 150000,
"Pune": 80000
}



6/9

Write:

def get_top_city(sales: dict) -> str:
"""
Returns city with highest sales.
"""

def get_low_sales_cities(sales: dict, threshold: int) -> dict:
"""
Returns dictionary of cities with sales below threshold.
"""

def increase_sales(sales: dict, percentage: float) -> dict:
"""
Returns a new dictionary with increased sales values.
Original dictionary must not be modified.
"""

Expectations
Use dictionary comprehension.
Preserve original dictionary where required.
Part D – Enhancement Task: Complete Missing
Features in app.py

You were shown a modular structure with files like:
app.py
employee_service.py
user_service.py
my_utils.py
Currently, some features such as:
Edit Employee
Delete Employee
Possibly search/list functionality
are incomplete or partially implemented.



7/9
Task: Implement Missing Features

1. Edit Employee Feature
Expected behavior:
Ask user for employee ID.
Check if employee exists in dictionary.
Allow updating:
Name
City
Salary
Validate salary is positive.
Update dictionary safely.
Implementation Guidance:
Use dict.get() to check existence.
Modify nested dictionary.
Do not recreate full dictionary unnecessarily.

2. Delete Employee Feature
Expected behavior:
Ask for employee ID.
If exists → remove from dictionary.
If not → print appropriate message.
Use pop() or del.

3. List All Employees
Expected behavior:
Iterate through dictionary.
Print structured format.
Display:
Employee ID
Name
City



8/9

Salary

4. Data Validation
Ensure:
Employee ID cannot be empty.
Salary must be numeric and positive.
City must be non-empty string.

5. Modular Design Expectations
Business logic should be inside employee_service.py.
app.py should only handle:
Menu
User input
Calling service functions
Avoid mixing input logic with data logic.
Evaluation Criteria

Criteria Weightage
Correct use of tuple 15%
Correct use of set 15%
Correct use of dict 25%
Implementation of missing features 25%
Code structure & modularity 20%
Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, you will:
Understand immutability (tuple).
Use mathematical set operations effectively.
Work with nested dictionaries.
Build structured service-based applications.
Practice modular architecture similar to real-world projects in cities like Mumbai and
Pune.



You are expected to submit:
1. Separate folders for each problem.
2. Completed app.py with implemented features.
3. Properly structured and tested code.
